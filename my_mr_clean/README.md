# Welcome to My Mr Clean
## Task
The task is to build a search engine similar to an article on wikipedia

## Description
We set the URL for the Wikipedia API url = "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php"
We set the parameters for the API request
We Sent a GET request to the API and retrieved the JSON response to get_content 
We extracted the JSON response
We cleaned the data using re(regular expression)
We initialised tokenization using re 
We Split the content into words based on whitespace and punctuation
We converted all content to lowercase
We got the most frequent words
We filtered the collections by removing the stop words
Thereafer, we used matplotlib library for drawing of graph for visualization

## Installation
There was no need for installation as it can easily be run

## Usage
The coding was run on a jupyter notebook whose http address can be gotten by running this in the terminal: 
jupyter notebook --no-browser 
Then the jupyter http address can be followed and the password: 'qwasar' inputed
